# Issues backlog

This file is a staging area for highly detailed issues designed from the roadmap. Each entry below maps to one pull request and is intended to be filed against the matching milestone on GitHub. Once an issue has been fully impelmented, the corresponding entry can be removed from this file.

Issues for later milestones will be added to this file in subsequent batches.

## Milestone: Repository, build scripts & CI

> All deliverables of this milestone are now implemented in the repository: core scaffolding (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`), the minimal `CMakeLists.txt` + `src/main.cpp`, the build scripts (`scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/build.ps1`, `scripts/build.cmd`), the `doctest`/CTest unit-test scaffold (issue #1), the GitHub Actions CI workflow (issue #2), the editor formatting config `.editorconfig` + `.clang-format` (issue #3), and the per-task agent skills under `.claude/skills/` (issue #4). No backlog entries remain for this milestone.

## Milestone: SDL3 window and game loop

> All deliverables of this milestone are now implemented in the repository. The manual `SDL_DelayNS`-based frame-cap fallback originally listed alongside V-Sync was deliberately deferred (see the rationale recorded in `docs/ROADMAP.md`); no backlog entries remain for this milestone.

## Milestone: Static playfield

> All deliverables of this milestone are now implemented in the repository: the fixed logical resolution with letterboxed scaling, the static playfield elements (paddles, ball, dashed center line) driven by layout helpers, and the placeholder `0 0` score rendered with a small hand-drawn 5x7 bitmap font that the Screens-and-menus milestone will reuse (the chosen approach is documented in `src/TextRenderer.h`). No backlog entries remain for this milestone.
